# Training and Testing
Download all python files from this Github platform  

Once finished this step, you can open the Pycharm in your computer and install all files in Pycharm.

Firstly, open arrhythmia.py, checked the code and set the data storage path 

code: path_ = 'D:/1_data science/1_code/ALAD_myDATA/data/arrhythmia.mat'

The dimension of data is up to you, pleasr don't forget to check the dimension in code to keep consistent with your data. 


Secondly, run the file 'run.py'

Thridly, after running finished, the two folds "train-logs" and "results" will be automatic produced.

The results files include evaluation results of the mode with the training step.

Some paratermers need to be adjusted for achieving better performance of models, such as

learning_rate

batch_size

latent_dim
