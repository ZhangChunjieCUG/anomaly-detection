#Installation
Install Anaconda and Pycharm in computer
 
#Requirments
 time
 numpy 
 tensorflow 
 logging
 importlib

 os
 sklearn

#Training and Test
Download C_ALAD.zip from this Github platform : green button "clone or download". Then, unzip it on your computer. (C_ALAD.zip flies includes all needed python files.) 
Once finished this step, you can open the Pycharm in your computer and install all files in Pycharm.

You will notice a files "run.py" and run it in Pycharm.

After running finished, the two folds "train-logs" and "results" will be automatic produced.
